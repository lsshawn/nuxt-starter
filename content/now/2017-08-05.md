What I'm doing now
==================

Bye Singapore.

Chatbots
--------

I'm building a Software-as-a-Service for small companies to hire chatbots for scaling their business.

  

Chatbot technology is changing the way we interact with technology. Just look at [Google Duplex](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html)!

  

I've worked on several chatbot projects and one intriguing question that I get a lot is this:

  
_How can I have multiple chatbots that can work like a team?_  
  

Imagine your marketing and helpdesk chatbot being able to communicate with each other to solve a customer problem.

  

Yes, I'm building chatbots to replace human work üòè. But not entirely. I think we're still far from that.

  

I build chatbot to free up your time so that you can focus on the more important parts of growing your business - leading, creative work, and solving problems.

One Day Build
-------------

Twice a month, I spend a day to create anything.

I choose an idea written in my notebook and give myself 1 day to execute on it.

One day to create an app.

One day to put together a video.

One day to MVP.
