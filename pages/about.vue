      <h2>Hi! I'm Shawn (:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>ABC: Always Be Creating</h3>      
      <div>I love making new stuffs - apps, chatbots, automations, articles, companies and friends.</div>
      <br> 
      <div>My ambitions are intrinsic and intellectual. I say no to many things so that I can have lots of time for learning, creating and giving.</div>

      <h3>I'm a World Citizen</h3>
      <div>I'm currently on the move, a lot. My idea is to stay at a place long enough until it feels like home, then move and start again.</div>
      <br>
      <div>I enjoy one-on-one conversation with locals and hear their stories.</div>
      <br>
      <div>I'm also constantly looking for opportunities to contribute to children in the places I visit. </div>
      <div>Check my <nuxt-link to='/now'>now</nuxt-link> page to see where am I currently.</div>
      
      <h3>I'm a Polygot</h3>

      <div>I speak 5 languages currently: Malay, Korean, Chinese, Cantonese, and English.</div>
      <br>
      <div>My motivation of learning new languages is this: to open up the heart of the people I'm talking to.</div>
      <br>
      <div>I learn new languages by talking to people and have never attended a formal class.</div>

      <h3>I'm a Minimalist</h3>

      <div>...and I have no luggage to check-in.</div>
      <br>
      <div>I only keep the bare necessities and have no problem donating your presents.</div>
      <br>
      <div>This is how I approach my work too: remove redundant codes and every design needs to be functional</div>
      <br>

      <h3>Questions?</h3>
      <div>I'd like to hear from you. <nuxt-link to='/contact'>Message me</nuxt-link>.</div>
